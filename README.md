# CartoonGAN (PyTorch)

This is a modified version of [Yijunmaverick's implementation](https://github.com/Yijunmaverick/CartoonGAN-Test-Pytorch-Torch) of [CartoonGAN](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/CameraReady/2205.pdf) `[Chen et al., CVPR18]`. This repo was created due to lack of activity in original repo.

This model is normally used for poster POCs and Blender3D->2D background tests and pre-processing, more like a Photoshop filter for visualising characters with the background before post-processing with light rays, additional shadows, among others.
